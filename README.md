# Lead 2.0

Because Lead and Lead_Rs didnt impress me, Lead was in Cpp, and Lead_Rs became sort of a mess.

Current progress: 

1. Added Rays, and bounding boxes, relatively clean for now
2. Added Shape trait, and sphere impl
3. Added placeholder trait/structs for future impls as they are referenced in current trait/sturcts including:
   1.  medium, medium_interface
   2.  bsdf, bssrdf, material,
   3.  areaLight
